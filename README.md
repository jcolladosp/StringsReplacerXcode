# StringsReplacerXcode
Python script that helps you to find strings in code and move them to localizable.strings in a Xcode proyect

## Usage
Just put script.py in the same folder as localizable.strings and execute in a terminal:

```
python script.py
```

Make sure you are executing it with Python 3. If you have more than one version installed you probably need to run it this way:

```
python3 script.py
```
## About the script

You can do whatever you want with the script and the code. This script was a introduction for me in Python language, so if you want to improve it or fix something, just mail me or pull request. :)
